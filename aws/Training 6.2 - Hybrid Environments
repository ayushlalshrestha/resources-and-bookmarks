AWS Direct Connect
- Dedicated network connection between an on-premises data center and AWS. 
- Private & consistent network link for faster & reliable data transfers compared to public internet connections.
- Uses open standard 802.1q VLANs that enables you to establish a dedicated private network connection from premises to AWS.
- Direct Connect connections consist of a single connection between your network and AWS with no inherent redundancy. Additionally, traffic coming from on-premises via a Direct Connect connect is restricted from internet access.


Site to Site VPN
- Connect on-prem networks to AWS VPC.
- Establish a secure & encrypted connection between on-premises network and AWS VPC over the internet. 
- Creates an IPsec VPN tunnel between your on-premises resources & resources within the AWS VPC. 
- This is suitable for scenarios where you have a hardware VPN appliance or a software VPN client on your on-premises network.
- 2 types of routing:
   - Static routing: requires you to specify all routes.
   - Use BGP to advertise its route to the Virtual Private Gateway.
- Use CloudHub to connect a VPN from multiple customer gateway devices to a single Virtual Private Gateway


AWS DataSync
- Data transfer service designed to simplify & accelerate moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS. 
- Optimizes the transfer process, handles encryption, and supports multiple protocols for seamless integration with existing storage infrastructure. 
- Similar to Database Migration Service (DMS), used for one-time migrations.
- You need to deploy a DataSync agent in on-premise.


Storage Gateway
- It is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises IT environments with AWS storage (Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier).
- Acts as a bridge, allowing you to store and retrieve data in AWS while keeping a local cache for low-latency access in on-prem.
- You need to deploy a Storage gateway agent in on-premise. They could be volume gateway, NFS gateway, etc.
- Create SMB `file share`, NFS, volume, FSx file share on the Storage gateway in AWS.
- The on-prem agent will cache or keep all the copy of data and communicate with the storage gateway in AWS.
- Types:
   1. File Gateway: allow on-prem to store objects in S3 via. NFS/SMB endpoints.
   2. Volume Gateway Stored mode: Async replication of on-prem data.
   3. Volume Gateway Cached mode: Primary data stored in S3 with frequent data cached locally.


Managed VPN:
- Managed IPSec VPN service by AWS that simplifies the setup and management of VPN connections.
- Usage: It is used when you want AWS to manage certain aspects of your VPN connection, making it easier to establish and maintain secure connections.
- Involves creating a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) in your VPC and configuring the customer gateway on your side. AWS takes care of the rest, including the configuration of the VPN connection.
- Quick & simple way to create a tunnel to an AWS VPC.


AWS VPC Endpoints
Is a feature in AWS that enable you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and APIs without requiring public internet access. With VPC endpoints, you can access AWS services directly from your VPC without traversing the internet, providing enhanced security and reducing data exposure risks.
Types of VPC Endpoints:
1. Interface Endpoints:
   - Interface endpoints are used to connect your VPC to AWS services using private IP addresses, just like Gateway Endpoints. However, they support a broader range of services, including services not natively powered by AWS PrivateLink.
   - Interface Endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, but AWS also allows third-party service providers to create their own VPC endpoint services using AWS PrivateLink.
   - Interface Endpoints use AWS PrivateLink technology to create a private connection between your VPC and the supported AWS service's endpoint.
   - They operate at Layer 3 (network layer) of the OSI model.
   - Interface Endpoints are used to access AWS services that support PrivateLink, such as Amazon S3, DynamoDB, and more.
   - Each Interface Endpoint is assigned one or more private IP addresses from your VPC's IP address range.
   - Examples of services accessible through Interface Endpoints include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), AWS CloudWatch, AWS Systems Manager, and many others.

2. Gateway Endpoints:
   - Gateway Endpoints are used to connect your VPC to AWS services that have their own internet gateway, such as Amazon S3.
   - It operates at Layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model.
   - Gateway Endpoints are available for specific AWS services and are used to access services over the AWS network backbone without traversing the public internet.
   - Gateway Endpoints are associated with a particular route table in your VPC to direct traffic to the endpoint.

3. Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints:
   - Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are used to connect your VPC to AWS services through a Gateway Load Balancer, which enables high availability and redundancy.
   - These endpoints are used specifically for AWS services that are integrated with Gateway Load Balancer.


AWS PrivateLink
- Highly available, scalable technology that you can use to privately connect your VPC to services as if they were in your VPC. You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.

Global Accelerator
- can reduce the amount of time users spend communicating the public internet, allowing them to hop on to the AWS network at edge locations physically closer to them.
- Static IP addresses route to endpoints in up to 10 different Regions, allowing for easy Regional failover if one of your endpoints in unresponsive.
- Your static entry points allow for origin masking and are protected by AWS Shield by default.

Summary:
- AWS Direct Connect focuses on establishing a dedicated network connection between on-premises and AWS
- AWS DataSync simplifies and accelerates data transfers
- Storage Gateway enables hybrid cloud storage by seamlessly integrating on-premises storage with AWS cloud storage services.

Some questions to ask to ChatGPT:
1. Is Storage gateway supported in S3, EFS and EBS?
2. what are VPC Endpoints and how do you use them ?
