# Neural Networks

### Courses in sequence

1. Neural Networks & Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep neural networks
    - Hyper parameter tuning
    - Regularization
    - Optimization
3. Structuring your Machine Learning Project
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Natural Language processing: Building sequence models
    - RNNs
    - LSTMs

### Notes

- Life is full of patterns and a Neural Network's job is to find these patterns and reproduce them.
- Shifting from Sigmoid to ReLu activation function has made Gradient Descent much faster
- Speed allows us to train bigger network with huge data

### Example: Housing

- Inputs may be: Size, #Bedrooms, zipcode, wealth
- Intermediary layer neurons may be: family size, walkability, school quality
- Output would be: Price
