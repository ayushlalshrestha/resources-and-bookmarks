Kuberenetes notes:
- kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- deploy nodes for eg. EC2 instances.
- each nodes will deploy EKS pods.
- A  pod hosts one or more containers
- the components of kubernetes are as:
    - The control plane: 
        - responsible for managing the state of the cluster.
        - API server: serves client requests and communicatees with the worker nodes
        - etcd: stores information about the cluster
        - controller manager:
            - manage controllers that manage the state of the cluster
            - eg. replication controller, deployment controller
        - scheduler: schedule pods for the worker nodes and fetches the capacity of the nodes.
    - Worker nodes:
        - kubelet: communicates with the control plane.
        - controller runtime: runs the containers, pulls image, etc.
        - kube-proxy: networking proxy, routing, load balancing.
