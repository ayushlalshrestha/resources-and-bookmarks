Cloudfront
- is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- It improves content delivery performance by caching content in edge locations worldwide.
- Has a global network of edge locations strategically placed across regions and countries.
- Edge locations act as caching endpoints, storing copies of content closer to end-users.
- CloudFront automatically routes user requests to the nearest edge location for faster delivery.
- The edge locations are distributed globally, covering major cities and regions worldwide.
- CloudFront can retrieve content from various origin servers hosted within or outside of AWS.
- It enhances content delivery by reducing latency and improving scalability and availability.


Amazon Elastic Transcoder
- Use Amazon Elastic Transcoder pipeline to transcode different qualities of a Video.

AWS Route 53
- scalable & highly available domain name system (DNS) web service.
- route internet traffic to web applications, making it easier for users to access resources by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.
- Domain Registration: purchase, manage, and renew domain names directly within the service.
- DNS Management: provides a global network of DNS servers that respond to DNS queries with low latency, reliability & fast resolution of domain names.
- DNS Health Checks resources & automatically route traffic away from unhealthy or unavailable resources to healthy ones.
- Traffic Routing & Load Balancing: distribute incoming traffic across multiple AWS resources or different endpoints based on routing policies like
    - latency-based routing
    - geolocation-based routing
    - geoproximity routing
    - weighted round robin routing
    - simple routing
- Global Acceleration: Route 53's Anycast network helps route end users to the nearest available endpoint, reducing latency and improving user experience.
- Domain Name Services: Route 53 supports a wide range of DNS record types, including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and more, enabling you to configure DNS settings for various purposes.
- Private DNS for VPC: It allows you to create a private DNS namespace for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), making it easy to resolve domain names for internal resources without exposing them to the public internet.
- Traffic Flow: Route 53 Traffic Flow simplifies the management of complex traffic-routing configurations by visualizing and managing how your domain's traffic is routed globally.
- Domain Name Transfer: You can transfer domain names to Route 53 from other registrars and consolidate your DNS management within AWS.
- Integration with AWS Services: Route 53 integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS CloudFront, enhancing overall application performance and reliability.
- Security: Route 53 supports DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to help secure DNS queries and responses against potential attacks.
- AWS Route 53 is a versatile service that serves as both a DNS resolver and a traffic router, providing the backbone for reliable and performant internet communication for your applications hosted on AWS or elsewhere.
