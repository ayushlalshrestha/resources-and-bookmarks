Security Groups: Definition of firewall rules

Types: 
- On-demand: Pay by the hour
- Reserved: 
    - reserved capacity for 1 to 3 years with upto 72% discount.
    - can be scheduled reserved instance.
- Spot: purchase unused capacity with upto 90% discount.
    - Spot Fleets: Collection of spot instances & (optionally) on-demand instances.
- Dedicated-hosts: A physical ec2 server reserved for you.


Instance types and Naming conventions:
- T for Burstable cpu performance instances
- M for general purpose
- C for compute
- R for Memory
- I & D for storage optimized

Placement groups:
- Cluster: in same AZ for low network latency.
- Spread: Placed on distinct underlying hardware in different AZ.
- Partial: Different network & power source in different AZ. Eg. for HBase cluster.
- You can move instances into a different placement group.

Network types in ec2:
- ENI: General purpose
- Elastic Network Adapter: 100Gb/s
- Elastic Fabric Adapter: For high performance computing (HPC) & machine learning applications. Support OS-bypass.

Notes:
- Processor, memory & storage can be added and removed.
- https://www.ec2instances.info  
- Elastic IPs can be used to assign static Public IPs to your ec2 cluster.
- AWS Compute Optimizer: Gives configuration recommendation based on usages.
- All inbounds are denied & all outbounds are allowed by default in a security group.
- Bootstrap script (*.sh) is provided as user data.
- ec2 metadata URL can be used to retrieve the information about the instance. Eg. `curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- Use AWS cloud vmware to deploy a vCenter in AWS.
- AWS Outposts: deploy AWS services in your own premises.
- If you want to include data from EBS volumes when creating an AMI, you need to take a separate snapshot of the EBS volumes and create a new AMI from those snapshots. This process is called creating a custom AMI.


Questions about EC2:
Q1: Does the EBS and root volumes also get included when creating an AMI from an ec2 Instance?
Answer: When creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an EC2 instance, by default, both the EBS volumes and the root volume are included in the created AMI.
An AMI is a snapshot of the entire state of an EC2 instance, including the operating system, applications, data, and any attached EBS volumes. When you create an AMI, it captures the contents of all the attached EBS volumes, including the root volume.
This means that when you launch a new EC2 instance from the created AMI, it will have an identical configuration, including all the EBS volumes and the root volume as they were at the time the AMI was created.
