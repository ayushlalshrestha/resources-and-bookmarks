Amazon Simple Storage Service
- Buckets & Objects.
- Object have a key & the key is the full path (prefix + object_name).
- query in place.
- Amazon Athena can be used to query unstructured data in S3.
- S3 objects can be versioned.
- Amazon Glacier can be used to archive old data.
- Amazon S3 transfer acceleration
- Use Cloudfront as proxy to cache s3 access

How is authentication and authorization handled when a program accesses an S3 object?
Ans: It is also controlled through IAM



Challenges:
- Hosting a static website using s3 bucket
- Changing permissions on a bucket through policy defined in JSON
- setting lifecycle policy for the current version and older versions
- setting replication for a bucket



Example Permission policy for an S3 bucket
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::website-229-replica-1/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketObjectLockConfiguration",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::website-229-replica-1"
        }
    ]
}
```
