Storage Options for ec2 instances:

EBS - Elastic Block Storage
- Is a Network drive, Network USB stick.
- Data transfer over network.
- Can be detached from 1 ec2 & attached to another ec2.
- Restricted to an availability zone.
- EBS (SSD variations): General Purpose vs. Provisioned IOPS .
- EBS (HDD variations): Throughput optimized vs. Cold HDD .
- Size can be increased (but not decreased). Reconfiguration in ec2 is necessary.
- ec2 delete_on_termination option
- Mount to attach a new EBS to an ec2

EBS Snapshots:
- Setup CloudWatch job to create a snapshot.
- Recreate a volume in tea new AZ.
- Snapshot lifecycle manager to create & delete snapshots.
- Convert an unencrypted EBS volume to an enrypted new volume
    - create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.
    - create a copy of the snapshot & select the `encrypt` option
    - create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot.
    - use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.


Types of EBS:
- gp2/gp3 SSD: general purpose balanced price vs. performance SSDs
- io1/io2 SSD: Highest performance SSD
- st1 HDD: Low cost high frequency HDD
- sc1 HDD: Lowest cost low frequency HDD

Instance Storage
- ephemeral, lose the data once the ec2 instance is stopped

EFS - Elastic File System
- Network file system that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances at once.
- Automatically scaling & backups.
- use cases: content management, web serving, data sharing.
- uses NFS v4.1 protocol.
- EFS is `3 x EBS` and `20 x S3` in costs.
- AWS DataSync connects On-prem to EFS.
- AWS Storage gateway - connect On-prem with cloud.
- Can handle upto 10 Gbps throughput
- Modes: General purpose vs. Max I/O
- Lifecycle management
- Create mount targets that defines interface that the clients can mount on.
- FSx for windows
- FSx for Lustre: for HPC applications which store directly to S3

AWS Backup
- Consolidation: Use AWS Backup to backup AWS services such as ec2, ebs, storage gateway, etc.
- Organizations: Use AWS Backup with AWS Organizations to backup different services to different accounts.
