Storage Options for ec2 instances:

EBS - Elastic Block Storage
- Is a Network drive, like Network USB stick.
- Data transfer over network.
- Can be detached from 1 ec2 instance & attached to another ec2.
- Restricted to an availability zone.
- EBS (SSD variations): General Purpose vs. Provisioned IOPS.
- EBS (HDD variations): Throughput optimized vs. Cold HDD.
- Size can be increased (but not decreased. reconfiguration in ec2 is necessary).
- ec2 'delete_on_termination' option.
- A new EBS should be explicitly 'mounted' to an ec2 instance.
- Amazon EBS Multi-Attach:
    - Attach a volume to multiple ec2 instances (upto 16)
    - Must use a filesystem that is cluster aware (not EX4, XFS)
- Data at rest & transition can be encrypted leveraging KMS keys.

EBS Snapshots:
- Setup CloudWatch job to create a snapshot.
- Recreate a volume in a new AZ or region.
- Snapshot lifecycle manager to create, archive & delete snapshots.
- Snapshots can be used to share to other users.
- Use-case: Convert an unencrypted EBS volume to an enrypted new volume
    - create a snapshot of the EBS volume.
    - create a copy of the snapshot to another region/AZ & select the `encrypt` option.
    - create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot.
    - use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

Types of EBS:
- gp2/gp3 SSD: general purpose balanced price vs. performance SSDs
- io1/io2 SSD: Highest performance SSD
- st1 HDD: Low cost high frequency HDD
- sc1 HDD: Lowest cost low frequency HDD
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express): highest-performance SSD volume designed for business-critical latency-sensitive transactional workloads.

Instance Storage
- ephemeral, lose the data once the ec2 instance is stopped

EFS - Elastic File System
- Network file system that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances at once.
- Automatic scaling & backups.
- use cases: content management, web serving, data sharing.
- uses NFS v4.1 protocol.
- EFS is `3 x EBS` and `20 x S3` in costs.
- Can handle upto 10 GBps throughput & 1000s of clients.
- Lifecycle management (from standard to EFS IA, etc).
- Create mount targets that defines interface that the clients can mount on.
- Modes (set at creation): 
    - Performance: General purpose vs. Max I/O.
    - Throughput: Bursting vs. Provisioned (i.e defined).

Notes on EFS:
- FSx for windows.
- FSx for Lustre: for HPC applications which store directly to S3.
- Region based. Can be made AZ specific for development.
- EFS has a security group.
- AWS DataSync helps transfer On-prem data to EFS.
- AWS Storage gateway - connect On-prem with cloud.

AWS Backup
- Consolidation: Use AWS Backup to backup AWS services such as ec2, ebs, storage gateway, etc.
- Organizations: Use AWS Backup with AWS Organizations to backup different services to different accounts.

Use-case: EFS to EC2:
Security Group Client ID (ID of the ec2 instance): sg-0110790f40dc05661
ips -- public:3.232.191.160, private:10.0.1.155

Mount command to EFS:
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0fefb4faddc367e2c.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs

Show details command:
sudo df -hT

Examine the write performance characteristics of your file system by entering the command:
sudo fio --name=fio-efs --filesize=10G --filename=./efs/fio-efs-test.img --bs=1M --nrfiles=1 --direct=1 --sync=0 --rw=write --iodepth=200 --ioengine=libaio
