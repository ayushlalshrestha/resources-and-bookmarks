Register instances in a LoadBalancer

ALB - Application load balancers
- Can redirect to multiple applications across machines (target groups).
- Can redirect to multiple appications (containers) on the same machine.
- Target group represents a cluster of compute instances for a single functionality to route the requests to, for eg.
    - ec2 instances (can be managed by ASGs)
    - ecs tasks
    - Lambda functions
    - IP Addresses (must be private)
- Stickiness in target group defines whether to set a cookie to always route requests from the same client to the same instance in a target group. 
- Routing tables to different target groups by defining listeners:
    - Based on the path in the URL.
    - Based on hostname of the URL.
    - Based on some query parameter, header of the request.
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS.
- Supports SSL/TLS termination, offload SSL decryption to the load balancer.
- Cross-Zone Load Balancing: Distributes traffic evenly across instances in multiple Availability Zones.

NLB - Network load balancers
- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances.
- Low latency (handle millions of MPS).
- NLB has 1 static IP per AZ.
- Provides a static IP address that can be associated with a load balancer.

In ec2 security group, you can only allow access to the ec2 from the security group of an ELB
