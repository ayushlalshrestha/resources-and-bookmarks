ALB - Application load balancers
- Can redirect to multiple applications across machines (target groups).
- Can redirect to multiple applications (containers) on the same machine.
- Target group: represents a cluster of compute instances for a single functionality to route the requests to, which could be:
    - ASG
    - ec2 instances
    - ecs services
    - Lambda functions
    - IP Addresses (must be private)
- Listeners: Mapping that defines the routing destinations (target group) to send incoming requests based on the combination of protocol and port. `Rules` can further be added on a `listener` to route to different target groups:
    - Based on the path in the URL.
    - Based on hostname of the URL.
    - Based on some query parameter, header of the request.
- Listeners on different ports to route to different target groups can be added in a single ELB.
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS.


NLB - Network load balancers
- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances.
- Low latency (handle millions of MPS).
- NLB has 1 static IP per AZ.
- Provides a static IP address that can be associated with a load balancer.

Notes:
- In ec2 security group, you can only allow access to the ec2 from the security group of an ELB.
- Stickiness in target group defines whether to set a cookie to always route requests from the same client to the same instance in a target group. 
- Supports SSL/TLS termination, offload SSL decryption to the load balancer.
- Cross-Zone Load Balancing: Distributes traffic evenly across instances in multiple Availability Zones.
- App server should see the `X-Forwarded-For` http header to see the IP of the client.
