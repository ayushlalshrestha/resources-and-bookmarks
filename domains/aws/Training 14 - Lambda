AWS Lambda:
- Make a Lambda function.
- Make an API Gateway.
- Route an API in the API Gateway to a Lambda function.
- Throw dependent packages to "lambda layers"

Lambda features:
- create `triggers` that trigger a lambda function. Eg. A file upload in an s3 bucket.
- Lambda functions has `IAM Roles`.
- You can optionally define the VPC, Subnet & SG for a Lambda function.
- Max 10Gb memory & 15 minutes execution time.


API Gateway:
- Central reverse proxy to route requests.
- Handles 100s of thousands of concurrent API calls.
- Upstream requests to ec2, lambda, other web applications.
- Can host & use multiple versions of your applications.
- Setup authorization, apply resource policies, throttle requests, Prevent DDoS.
- Use AWS WAF with API Gateway to protect web applications.
- Gateway can 1st request a lambda function which authenticates the request from Cognito & then forward the request to another lambda which handles the business logic.

AWS Step Funtions:
- Serverless workflow service for creating, coordinating, and automating workflows.
- State Machines: Define complex sequences of tasks (states) to build application workflows.


AWS EventBridge:
- serverless event bus service that connects your applications with data from various sources.
- delivers a stream of real time data from your own applications, SaaS applications & AWS services & then routes the data to targets.
- create cron jobs.
- EventBridge receives an event, an indicator of a change in environment, and applies a rule to route the event to a target. Rules match events to targets based on either the structure of the event, called an event pattern, or on a schedule. For example, when an Amazon EC2 instance changes from pending to running, you can have a rule that sends the event to a Lambda function.
- more advanced than simple event triggers with more features like filtering events, more destinations, etc.


Example Lambda example Use case:
- Create an S3 bucket & a Lambda function.
- Create a new Event Trigger in the S3 (or through the function) which triggers the lambda function when an object gets created in s3. The function will write data to dynamoDB.
- Create an SNS topic & create a email notification in it.
- Crate another Lambda function, add a trigger for DynamoDB insert. This method then triggers the email notification.
