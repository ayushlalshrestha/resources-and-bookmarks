VPC (Virtual Private cloud)
- A VPC can extend across an entire AWS Region (regional resource)
- A VPC is divided into subnets (Availability zone resource)
- For a subnet to have internet access:
    - Attach a public gateway to a VPC.
    - Add a route to a route table to route 0.0.0.0 to the Internet gateway
    - Attach the routetable to a subnet.
- A subnet once configured in an Availability zone, cannot be migrated to another zone.
- An ec2 instance, once deployed cannot be switched to another subnet.
- Use Elastic IP service to have a static IP address.

Bastion Host:
- Only this ec2 instance is present in a public subnet which can be SSHed.
- Other ec2 instances and RDS should be in private subnets. 
- We then use `ssh -A <user@bastion-host>` to propagate local keys.
- From there, we now SSH into other ec2 instances in the VPC.

NACL
- Network Level Access control that is attached to a subnet.
- All inbound & outbound connections are denied in custom NACLs.
- NACLs can have both allow and deny rules while SG is for allow rules only.
- NACLs are stateless.


NAT Gateway 
- Way to give internet access to private subnets.
- Attach a NAT Gateway in a subnet (1) with an Internet gateway.
- Then, route 0.0.0.0/0 destinations from a subnet (2) with no internet access to the NAT Gateway of the 1st subnet, which will expose internet outbound access from the 2nd subnet.


## Connecting Networks
VPC Peering
- connect 2 different regions (2 different VPCs) by creating a `Peering connection` and including it in the route tables of the VPCs.


Transit gateways
- make it easy to have peering between a lot of VPCs.
- allows for hub-and-spoke networking between VPCs that is easily extensible in the future.
- eliminates the need for direct VPC-to-VPC peering connections.


VPC Endpoints: 
- privately connect your VPC to AWS services.
- are used to keep your traffic to AWS services out of public networking space. 
- 2 types: Interface and Gateway endpoints.

PrivateLink
- allows you to share out a single endpoint and not your entire VPC.
