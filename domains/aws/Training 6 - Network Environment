VPC (Virtual Private cloud)
    - A VPC can extend across an entire AWS Region (regional resource)

Subnets - Dividing the VPC (Availability zone resource)

Attach public gateway to a VPC and route table, attach the routetable to a subnet.

`ssh -A` option to propagate local keys to other server.

Use Elastic IP service to have a static IP address.

NACL
- Network Level Access control that is attached to subnet.
- Create NACLs and attch them to subnets.


NAT Gateway 
- Way to give internet access to private subnets.
- Attach a NAT Gateway in a subnet with Internet gateway and route 0.0.0.0/0 destinations from a subnet with no internet access to the NAT Gateway of the 1st subnet, which will expose internet outbound access from the 2nd subnet. 

An ec2 instance, once deployed cannot be switched to another subnet.
A subnet once configured in an Availability zone, cannot be migrated to another zone.

VPC pairing to connect 2 different regions (2 different VPCs) by creating a `Peering connection` and including it in the route tables of the VPCs.

Site to Site VPN: Connect your on-prem network to your VPC

Transit gateways make it easy to have peering between a lot of VPCs.
