Aurora
- Fully managed RDS service for mysql, postgres.
- Cross-AZ Master & Read-Replica architecture (Primary & Aurora replicas).
- Writes go through the `cluster endpoint` to the Main instance.
- Reads go through the `reader endpoint` to Read-replica through an ELB.
- Read replication is asynchronous.
- 5x performance than SQL.
- Note: If a read request arrives before a newly written row has been propagated to the read replicas in Amazon Aurora, the read request may not immediately see the newly written row due to replication lag.

Aurora features:
- Upto 15 replicas.
- Asynchronous replications in milliseconds.
- 2 copies in atleast 3 AZs are always replicated.
- Share aurora snapshots with other accounts.
- 3 types of replicas: aurora replicas, sql & postgres replicas.
- Automated failover with aurora replicas.
- Aurora serverless for unpredictable workloads.


DynamoDB
- Managed, multi-AZ NoSQL data store.
- Has Cross-Region replication option.
- Single digit millisecond latency.
- Supports both documents & key-value storage.
- Defaults to eventual consistency reads but can request strong consistency.
- Priced on throughput.
- Encryption at rest using KMS.
- Stored across 3 different geographically different data centres.

DynamoDB features:
- Stored in SSDs.
- DynamoDB transactions: For ACID property (Max 25 items or 4MB).
- Point in time recovery: Incremental backups each 5 minutes for last 35 days.
- Dynamo Streams: Time-ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table.
- Global tables: Multi master mutli region replication (replicaiton latency <1 sec)
- Dynamo DB Accelerator (DAX)
    - In-memory cache for dynamo DB.
    - Reduces request time from milli to micro seconds.



Other DBs:
- DocumentDB as an alternative to MongoDB
- Keyspaces as an alternative to Cassandra
- Neptune as a graph DB
- Timestream for time-series DB
