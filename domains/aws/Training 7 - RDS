What is RDS:
- Managed database service for MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle, etc.
- Automated provisioning, OS Patches.
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps (point in time restore).
- Read replicas for improved read performances.
- Multi AZ setup of Disaster recovery.
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1).
- Supports vertical scaling (storage auto scaling) vs. horizontal scaling (with read replicas)/
- Use RDS & not NoSQL if complex joins across tables is required.
- RDS being SQL provides ACID transactions.
- RDS storage auto-scaling: increase RDS storage dynamically.

Automated backups:
- Daily full backups during scheduled maintenance window.
- Transactional logs are backed up every 5 minutes.
- 7 days retention by default.
- manual snapshots can also be taken.

Read Replication:
- Improve read performance by making exact copy of your database.
- Replication is asynchronous hence only eventually consistent.
- Upto 5 read replicas.
- Within AZ, cross AZ or cross region.
- Each read replica has a DNS.
- Read Replicas can be converted to their own DB.
- Read replicas across region will cost $$.
- Automatic backups must be enabled to deploy a read replica.

Multi AZ replication for Disaster replication:
- Synchronous replication hence always consistent (Master & StandBy).
- One DNS name - automatic app failaover to standby.
- Consistency comes at a cost of Availability.
- Read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ replicas too.
- Multi AZ is for disaster recovery & not for performance.

Notes:
- When creating an RDS, the paramaters are stored in the Parameters store of Systems manager.
- Any ec2 application should access the parameters from the parameters store 
for which it requires accurate access through IAM Role & policies.

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):
- Homogeneous migration
- Hetergenous migration
- AWS Schema conversion tool (SCT): Change DB engine type between source & target.
    - create a target DB
    - migrate the DB schema
    - setup the data replication process
    - initiate the data transfer & confirm completion
    - switch production to the new DB
