What is RDS:
- Automated provisioning, OS Patches
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps
- Read replicas for improved read performances.
- Multi AZ setup of Disaster recovery
- Scaling capabilities (vertical & horizontal)
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- supports vertical scaling (storage auto scaling) vs. horizontal scaling (with read replicas)
- storage backend by EBS

Automated backups:
- Daily full backups during the maintanence window
- Transactional logs are backed up every 5 minutes
- 7 days retention by default

Read Replication:
- Upto 5 read replicas
- Within AZ, cross AZ or cross region
- Replication is asynchronous hence only eventually consistent
- Read Replicas can be converted to their own DB
- Read replicas across region will cost $$

Multi AZ replication for Disaster replication:
- Synchronous replication hence always consistent (Master & StandBy)
- Consistency comes at a cost of Availability
- One DNS name - automatic app failaover to standby
- Read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ replicas too

When creating an RDS, the paramaters are stored in the Parameters store of Systems manager.

Any ec2 application should access the parameters from the parameters store 
for which it requires accurate access through IAM Role & policies.
