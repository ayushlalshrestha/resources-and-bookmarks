Amazon AppFlow
- Fully-managed integration service that enables you to securely exchange data between software as a service (SaaS) applications, such as Salesforce, and AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift. 
- For example, you can ingest contact records from Salesforce to Amazon Redshift or pull support tickets from Zendesk to an Amazon S3 bucket

AWS Migration Hub
- Centralized service to track & manage application migrations to the AWS cloud. 
- Provides a single dashboard to monitor progress, errors, and status of multiple migration projects across various AWS services and tools. This makes it easier to plan, execute, and oversee large-scale migrations with visibility and control.


RDS Multi-AZ Failover
- Failover is automatically handled by Amazon RDS so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, which is in turn promoted to become the new primary. We encourage you to follow best practices and implement database connection retry at the application layer.
- Failovers, as defined by the interval between the detection of the failure on the primary and the resumption of transactions on the standby, typically complete within one to two minutes. Failover time can also be affected by whether large uncommitted transactions must be recovered; the use of adequately large instance types is recommended with Multi-AZ for best results. AWS also recommends the use of Provisioned IOPS with Multi-AZ instances for fast, predictable, and consistent throughput performance.


AWS RDS Multi-AZ Failover:
- The CNAME is switched from the primary db instance to the secondary.
- Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.
- Failover is automatically handled by Amazon RDS so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, which is in turn promoted to become the new primary.


Identity Federation with ADFS
- Question: A fintech company has a hybrid cloud that consists of an on-premises solution and some assets within AWS. They want all of their developers to access resources in both environments using their on-premises Active Directory (AD) credentials. In this scenario, which of the following can be used to fulfill this requirement?
- Answer: Use Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) to create a SAML 2.0-based federation.
This would allow you to create a hybrid environment between cloud and on-premises.


AWS DMS
- Create a new AWS DMS task using the Migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes (CDC) option to migrate to AWS while capturing changed data.
- AWS DMS offers the ability to enable Change Data Capture during migrations, which allows replication of ongoing data changes from the source to your target data store. This allows you to ensure all data is synced post migration. Use the AWS DMS SCT to enable CDC on the migration task so that changed data is captured during the migration efforts. 
- The AWS SCT does not perform migrations; it is only used for converting database schemas and engine types.
- AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) makes it easy to migrate your relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other data stores to or from the AWS cloud. You can do ongoing replications or just one-time migrations.


Amazon Kendra
- Allows you to create an intelligent search service powered by machine learning. It is not used for sentiment analysis.

Amazon Comprehend
- Uses natural-language processing (NLP) to help you understand the meaning and sentiment in your text.

Amazon SageMaker
- Train machine learning models to identify patterns and anomalies in your data using Amazon SageMaker.
- Fully managed machine learning service. Amazon SageMaker allows you to build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.
